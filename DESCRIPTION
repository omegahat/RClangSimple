Title: R Interface to the clang parser's C API
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
SystemRequirements: libclang  (the library, not the compiler executable)
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@r-project.org>
Description: This package is currently an interface to some of the
    functionality in the clang parsing facilities.
    The idea is to be able to extract information from C and C++
    source files and headers so that we can do semantic analysis
    on the contents and use this information in various different
    ways. One application is to be able to programmatically generate
    bindings to arbitrary C/C++ routines.  The functionality here
    is similar to the basic facilities in RGCCTranslationUnit.
    We will probably develop a richer and more powerful interface 
    using the C++ API that will give us access to more features of the AST
    classes.
    We can analyze not only the declarations but the body of the code 
    of C routines.  This allows us to analyze routines in existing C 
    libraries and determine information such as what inputs they mutate,
    how memory management is done, how to interface R data types to them.
    This is far from trivial, but feasible. 
    We can also use this to analyze routines and find global variables
    suggeest and/or implement refactoring to remove these and 
    permit parallel execution.
    We can, in the extreme, recover simple C routines into higher
    level instructions and then try to parallelize them in R.
